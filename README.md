This is a two player game where on each turn, the player whose turn it is needs to decide whether to move their pawn or place a fence. The goal of the game is to reach the other player's side of the gameboard, while also preventing the other player from reaching your side.


### How to Use

This game has a graphic user interface (GUI), so the players can simply user their mouse to click on the square they want to move to, or click on the space between two squares in order to place a fence.

### Player Movement

Players may move to any adjecent square that is unblocked by a fence, a player, or the edge of the board. The player may not move diagonally when not blocked.

If a player is blocked by an opponent, they may jump over the opponent.

If a player is blocked by an opponent, and the opponent has a fence behind them that prevents a jump-over, the player may move diagonally.

## Background

This program was assigned to me during Intro to Computer Science as a portfolio project during my time at Oregon State University while pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science.

This was the final culmination of the intro classes where we learned the fundamentals of coding logic and data structures. Originally, the game was designed to be played at the command line using classes and class methods. Therefore, we were only responsible for coding the underlying logic of the game. However, after completing the required assignment, I went a step forward and created a GUI for the game in order to learn more about the pygame module.
